# Virtual-Reality---Engineering-Block

 Virtual Reality tour of JECRC University is the environment that is simulated
by a computer and other peripherals like Oculus Rift, Kinect, and Hydra etc. It is
primarily a visual experience, displayed either on a computer screen or through special
stereoscopic displays, but some simulations include additional sensory information,
such as sound through speakers or headphones. Users can interact with a virtual
environment either through the use of standard input devices such as a keyboard and
mouse. The simulated environment can be similar to the real world, for example,
virtually roaming around the campus, navigating through the doors, etc
